# 1 Introduction

Yield monitor data from various crops is known for containing erroneous
yield values due to multiple causes, including partially-filled header,
abrupt changes in travel velocity, poor GPS signal, among others. These
erroneous data points need to be removed to ensure data quality before
yield maps can be used for practical purposes. Studies have reported
removing from 10% to 50% of yield monitor data points due to poor data
quality, with significant differences in field-level yield average,
standard deviation, range, and coefficient of variation between raw and
cleaned yield monitor data (Sudduth et al., 2012).

Yield Editor software (Sudduth et al., 2007; Sudduth et al., 2012) was
developed to provide a clear workflow for yield monitor data cleaning
and includes a total of 12 filters/steps. These are

-   Grain flow delay  
-   Start pass delay  
-   Minimum and maximum velocity  
-   Smooth velocity  
-   Minimum swath  
-   Minimum and maximum yield  
-   Position  
-   Manual

Although Yield Editor was developed and tested on multiple crops, cotton
was not part of the original set of tested crops. With the increasing
adoption of cotton yield monitors, there is a need to understand to what
extent cotton yield monitor data is impacted by different sources of
error. Moreover, Yield Editor is a windows-based point-and-click
software useful for practitioners. This limits its use and adoption
because i) non-windows users have limited options to access it, and ii)
though the software offers batch processing, it is not written in a
common scientific programming language to be easily expanded for
scientists.

The overall objectives of this research are to

1.  translate the current filters implemented in Yield Editor into an R
    package to be used by scientists;  
2.  deploy the R package into a web-based application that can be easily
    used by practicioners and independent of operating system; and  
3.  apply the filtering functions to cotton yield monitor data sets to
    assess the extent to which these data are affected by erroneous data
    points.

This report includes the development and application of **5 filters**
used in Yield Editor, and will focus on exploring **objective 3**.

# 2 Material and Methods

## 2.1 Field information

Cotton yield monitor data used in this report was collected in 2019 at
the field Shy North belonging to the grower Keith Bowen. Detailed
agronomic information such as planting date, variety, fertilization,
seeding rate, chemical control program, irrigation, among others are
beyond the scope of this report and were not included. Cotton was
harvested between November 29th and December 2nd.

Lint yield was calculated assuming that the column VRYILDBAL was lint
yield in ba/ac, assuming 480 lbs of lint/ba, and transforming to SI unit
of kg/ha.

## 2.2 Yield Editor filters implemented

This report implemented 5 Yield Editor filters:  
**1. Minimum and maximum yield**  
The yield filter utilizes a histogram approach to define lower and upper
boundaries for acceptable yield values. The algorithm extracts the 10%
and 99% percentiles of the yield distribution, expands them in 25%, and
uses these expanded lower and upper boundaries to define the acceptable
range of yield values.

**2. Minimum and maximum velocity**  
The velocity filter utilizes the same concept as described above, but
with different parameter values. The algorithm extracts the 8% and 90%
percentiles of the velocity distribution, expands them in 18%, and uses
these expanded lower and upper boundaries to define the acceptable range
of velocity values.

**3. Position**  
The position filter utilized a similar concept as described above, and
incorporates a 40-m negative buffer. The implementation of the original
filter proposed by Sudduth et al.Â (2012) did not remove any data points
on our data set. Thus, the position filter was adapted to keep only
observations within the negative buffer of 40-m from the field boundary.
This approach removes any data points outside of the field boundary, and
also data points from end-rows and combine maneuvering areas.

# 3 Results

## 3.1 **Raw** yield data

The raw yield data set had 142,944 observations, ranging from 18 to
515,949 kg lint/ha (Fig. 1), with a standard deviation (sd) of 2666 and
a coefficient of variation of 146%.

</div>

For displaying purposes only, the raw yield data was filtered to contain
only observations with yield less than 5,000 kg lint/ha. Low yield areas
were observed across the field, and distinctively present at end-rows
(Fig. 2).

## 3.2 **Cleaned** yield data

### 3.2.1 Individual filter effect

When considered separately, the **minimum and maximum yield filter** was
the one with the largest impact on reducing standard deviation (from
2666 on raw data to 741) and coefficient of variation (from 146% on raw
data to 41%), while removing only \~1% of total observations (Table 1).
The position filter removed the most observations (7% of total), with
little impact on standard deviation and coefficient of variation.

| Filter type |      n | Proportion of obs. kept | min | median | mean |    max |   sd |  cv |
|:------------|-------:|------------------------:|----:|-------:|-----:|-------:|-----:|----:|
| raw         | 142944 |                    1.00 |  18 |   1865 | 1828 | 515949 | 2666 | 146 |
| minmaxyield | 141493 |                    0.99 |  66 |   1869 | 1808 |   3989 |  741 |  41 |
| minmaxspeed | 142529 |                    1.00 |  18 |   1867 | 1814 |  84970 |  885 |  49 |
| pos         | 132809 |                    0.93 |  18 |   1912 | 1886 | 515949 | 2748 | 146 |

### 3.2.2 Combined filter effect

These different filters are supposed to be used in combination. This is
important as although there is overlap among filters (i.e., some
observations are flagged by multiple filters), they also work
complimentary with some observations being flagged by a single filter.

When combined, the lowest standard deviation and coefficient of
variation was observed with the 5 filters applied (Table 2). This was
also the scenario that removed the most observations, keeping 92% of the
original data points. Both mean and median lint yield were larger using
all 5 filters compared to the raw data, indicating that in the case of
this data set, **uncleaned data underestimated yield**.

| Filter type                 |      n | Proportion of obs. kept | min | median | mean |    max |   sd |  cv |
|:----------------------------|-------:|------------------------:|----:|-------:|-----:|-------:|-----:|----:|
| raw                         | 142944 |                    1.00 |  18 |   1865 | 1828 | 515949 | 2666 | 146 |
| minmaxyield                 | 141493 |                    0.99 |  66 |   1869 | 1808 |   3989 |  741 |  41 |
| minmaxyield+minmaxspeed     | 141222 |                    0.99 |  66 |   1871 | 1811 |   3989 |  739 |  41 |
| minmaxyield+minmaxspeed+pos | 131674 |                    0.92 |  66 |   1914 | 1862 |   3989 |  709 |  38 |

Table 2. Effect of combined filters on lint yield statistics.

All yield data points flagged by one or more combined filters were
removed, with their location in the field shown on Fig. 3.

<p class="caption">

</p>

</div>

The majority of yield points removed were due to the **position filter**
alone (within a 40-m negative buffer from the field boundary), followed
by the filters **minimum yield, minimum yield + position, maximum yield,
minimum velocity**, and others (Table 3).

| flag          |    n |
|:--------------|-----:|
| pos           | 9548 |
| miny          |  537 |
| miny-pos      |  382 |
| maxy          |  365 |
| minv          |  146 |
| minv-pos      |  125 |
| miny-minv-pos |   55 |
| miny-minv     |   52 |
| maxy-minv     |   35 |
| maxy-pos      |   23 |
| maxy-minv-pos |    2 |

A side-by-side comparison between raw and cleaned cotton yield monitor
data maps is shown on Fig. 4. By removing yield and velocity outliers
and areas known for causing erroneous yield values (near field border),
it becomes clearer to identify high and low yielding areas based on the
yield monitor cleaned map.

# 4 Summary and next steps

In summary:  
- Raw yield monitor data contains erroneous observations that need to be
removed.  
- Here we implemented **5 filters** included on Yield Editor software.  
- The most important individual filter was the **minimum and maximum
yield**.  
- The combination of **all 5 filters** produced data with the **least
variability** based on theoretically sound reasons.

Next steps:  
1. Implement other filters identified as important by Sudduth et
al.Â (2012), like the **delay and overlap filters**.

2.  Test filters on more cotton yield monitor data sets and obtain a
    generalizable measure of importance for cleaning this type of data.

3.  Continue software development towards publishing an R package for a
    scientific audience, accompanied by a web-based application for
    practitioners.
